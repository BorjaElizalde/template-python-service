description: Use to start, open or resume the session of any task or subagent — a new task, or an existing issue with or without a worktree or a session. Finds or creates the issue, creates or reuses its worktree, and opens, resumes or brings forward its session. Also use to park, release or link an issue, and to plan a backlog.

Every subagent session belongs to one issue in BorjaElizalde/template-python-service and works in its own worktree,
research tasks included: the worktree is the agent's workspace for notes, test runs and drafts.
The same steps start a new task and pick up an existing one.

1. Find the issue. Given a number, use it. Otherwise search the open issues with
   `gh issue list -R BorjaElizalde/template-python-service --state open --search "<keywords>"` and reuse one that
   covers the task. Otherwise create one with `gh issue create -R BorjaElizalde/template-python-service`: an imperative
   title, and a body that states the goal, the scope, and what done means. For a research or a
   design task, also say where its result goes: a PR, or a comment on the issue. The issue is the
   session's whole brief: it sees nothing of the conversation that started it, so the body
   carries every decision already taken and what the conversation found out. On an existing
   issue, add what was settled since as a comment. Never point a task at a scratchpad, `/tmp` or
   `/private/tmp` path: a restart wipes them, and a consumer project lost a task's input files
   that way. What a task needs goes in the issue, or the task rebuilds it.
2. Pick the branch type. It is the task's mode, for the task's life:
   - **Execution**, the default: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor` or `chore` for a change, `research`
     for a task whose result is an answer. Its session works alone and never waits for a person.
   - **Design**: `design`, only when the owner asks to work the task out together ("with me",
     "let's design", "let's discuss"), never on your own guess. Its session asks the owner, in
     its Terminal tab, what is the owner's to decide, and builds nothing: its result, delivered
     as a research task's, is the decisions taken and the issues for the work.

   The type names a new branch only: an issue that has a branch keeps it, and its mode. To talk
   an execution task through, the owner uses its PR; to build what a design task decided, start
   execution tasks from its issues.
3. Run `bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/task.sh" start <n> <type>`. Before anything else, it
   refuses a type it does not know, and an issue that must wait (see below), naming its open
   blocker or the reason it is parked: tell the owner, and start nothing in its place. Otherwise
   it first runs `task.sh cleanup`, which finishes every task whose issue is closed, as a bare
   `/task:finish` does, then prints the status line of every other task, with no backlog. Then it
   picks up what the issue already has:
   - its worktree, else its branch (left without a worktree, or pushed from another clone), else
     a new branch from `origin/develop`;
   - its running session, brought to the front and never opened twice, else its last session,
     resumed, else a new one, in the mode of its branch, which the session line names.

   A new or resumed session starts with a prompt that sends it to the issue and its comments. A
   running session gets no prompt: send it what changed with SendMessage.
4. Return the issue URL, the worktree path, the session name, its mode and what the script picked
   up. Then report the status through `/task:status`.

## Issues that must wait

No agent starts an issue that is blocked or parked. GitHub holds both facts:

- **Blocked:** a "blocked by" link to an open issue. The link is the reason, and it clears itself
  when the blocker closes. Add one with
  `gh issue edit <n> -R BorjaElizalde/template-python-service --add-blocked-by <m>`, or with `--blocked-by <m>` on
  `gh issue create`; `--remove-blocked-by <m>` removes one.
- **Parked:** the `backlog` label, with a comment that starts with `Parked:` and gives the reason.
  Only the owner's word parks or releases an issue. Park it with
  `bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/task.sh" park <n> "<reason>"`, which posts the comment,
  then adds the label, which it creates where it does not exist yet. Release it with
  `gh issue edit <n> -R BorjaElizalde/template-python-service --remove-label backlog`.

## Plan a backlog

When the owner says "plan X", start a `research` task for it, whose session works alone. When the
owner says "plan X with me", start a `design` task, whose session works the plan out with them.
Either issue's body asks its session to:

1. study the code and the open issues;
2. create one issue per piece of work, whose body states its goal, its scope and what done means,
   as step 1 asks of any issue;
3. put them in order, creating each one `--blocked-by` the issues it waits for;
4. park each one with
   `bash .claude/skills/task/scripts/task.sh park <n> "planned in #<this issue>, waits for the owner's review"`;
5. post, as its result, a comment on this issue that lists them in order.

A research session never waits for the owner, who corrects its plan afterwards. Either way, the
owner tells the main session which issues to release.
